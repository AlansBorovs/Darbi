Basically a JavaScript code which will look for the Latvian flag and print out the names who have them at https://nordicfuzzcon.org/Statistics/Attendeelist

Please note that this code assumes that the flag and name elements are direct children of a common parent element. If the actual HTML structure is different, you may need to adjust the code accordingly. Also, please be aware that web scraping may violate some websitesâ€™ terms of service. Always make sure you have permission to scrape a website before doing so.
